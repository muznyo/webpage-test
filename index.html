      <p>Hey fellow bread lover. I think we can agree on the fact that bread deserves
        more recognition. It's truly a versatile food, and it stood the test of time
        really well. You may not like some variants, and that's okay! But bread is
        undeniably great. That's why I made Project Dough! With your help, we'll be
        able to establish a fully functional bread kingdom. </p>

      <p>Down below we'll take a look at the history of bread, the different variants,
        you know the deal.</p>

  <!-- Small paragraph about bread -->
  <div class="hstack-wrap">
    <div class="hstack-wrap-item">
      <p>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water,
        usually by baking. Throughout recorded history, it has been a prominent
        food in large parts of the world. It is one of the oldest man-made foods,
        having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture, and
        plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.</p>

      <p>Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals,
        industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. In many countries,
        commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color,
        shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.</p>

      <p>In other words, bread is the best food to ever exist. It's very important
        in our daily life and has served humanity for generations. Bread was and still
        is truly the beginning of a new tomorrow. And this is only one small step
        towards the ultimate bread form, where it trascends and asserts dominance. I
        love bread, it's truly the best food ever, period. If you argue there's
        anything better than my trustworthy bread (unless it's cats ofc), your last
        words will be exactly those you had the "courage" to spit out of your mouth.</p>

        <h4>Dead body reported</h4>
        <p>Me (M13) screamed "dead body reported" at my aunt's funeral. My mom said
          that my aunt died and that we are going to her funeral the next morning. As
          soon as she left the room crying, I busted out laughing because it reminded
          me of among us, a popular video game. So as we were riding in the car I was
          thinking about saying "dead body reported" at the funeral. When we finally
          arrived I screamed "dead body reported", everyone was looking at me like
          some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my grandfather's sister fell
          in the vents and died when she was 2 years old. So I said "grandpa's sister
          sus she vented". My grandfather started crying and everyone was screaming at
          me instead of laughing. My mom took my x box and said that I am going to
          therapist tomorrow. I dunno bro, my mom is acting kinda sus</p>
